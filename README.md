- **Interactive Chart** - Click legend items to show/hide specific drinks

## üî¨ How It Works

The calculator uses caffeine's 5-hour half-life - meaning half the caffeine is gone every 5 hours:
```
Remaining = Initial √ó 0.5^(hours_elapsed / 5)
```

### Keep in Mind
- Everyone metabolizes caffeine differently (3-7 hour range)
- Doesn't account for body weight or tolerance
- Assumes instant absorption (actually takes 30-120 minutes)
